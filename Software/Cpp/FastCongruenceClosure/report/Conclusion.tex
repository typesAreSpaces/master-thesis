\section{Conclusion}

In this technical report we have discussed several algorithms and their intricate connections.
The exhaustive testing and final performance results indicate the correctness of the
implementation. For the future work, we plan to code the interpolation algorithms
efficiently using C++ and the current fast congruence closure algorithm. The latter
is already defined as a package by itself. Also, it is still pending to compare
the performing results of the current algorithms with the MathSAT 5 package. I predict
that the new interpolantion algorithms should outperform the ones used in the the MathSAT 5
software.
