  This report presents the activities during \textit{Master Thesis I} given
  by Prof. Deepak Kapur. We discuss algorithms to compute implicational closure,
  congruence closure and interpolants for quantifier-free theories of equality
  over uninterpreted symbols and octagonal formulas. Also, it is discussed the
  implementation of these algorithms, the results and performance obtained.
  Among the objectives of my thesis is the efficient implementation of Prof.
  Kapur's interpolation algorithms and compare performance with \textit{state
    of the art} algorithms for the same theories, mainly using as a reference
  the SAT solver \textit{MathSAT 5}.
