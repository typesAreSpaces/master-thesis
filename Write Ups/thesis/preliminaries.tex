\chapter {Preliminaries} \label{preliminaries}

This chapter discusses basic concepts from first-order logic that are used in the rest of this thesis. We will pay particular attention to their language and semantics since these are fundamental concepts necessary to understand the algorithmic constructions to compute interpolants. For a comprehensive treatment on the topic, the reader is suggested the following references \cite{10.5555/1642730, DBLP:books/daglib/0076838}.
