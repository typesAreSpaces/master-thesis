Interpolation algorithms for the theory of equality 
with uninterpreted functions are relevant as the core 
component of verification algorithms. Bounded/unbounded 
model checking and invariant generation benefit from 
interpolation algorithms. In \cite{10.1007/3-540-58179-0_44}, 
the authors introduced a methodology to debug and verify 
the control logic of pipelined microprocessors by encoding 
the hardware and its specification
into an EUF solver.

Previous work addressing the interpolation problem for 
EUF has involved techniques ranging from
interpolant-extraction from refutational proof
trees \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_2, mcmillan2011interpolants, 
10.1007/978-3-642-31612-8_24}, and colored congruence closure
graphs \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-00768-2_34}. Kapur's algorithm 
for computing uniform interpolants
employs a different approach using approximated
quantifier-elimination, a procedure that given a formula, 
it produces a logically equivalent formula without 
some variables \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0076838}.
