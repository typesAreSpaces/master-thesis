\section{Conclusions}

This chapter showed the implementation of the
interpolation combination algorithm in 
\cite{10.1007/11532231_26} and the necessary
changes for the EUF and UTVPI algorithms
presented in previous chapters. 

In addition, a new algorithm for the uniform interpolant
generation for the combined theory of EUF + UTVPI 
was introduced. The implementation of this algorithm
is will be considered in the future if the rules 8 and 9
can be replaced for propagation rules that
avoid splitting.
