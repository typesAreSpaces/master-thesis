\section{Conclusions}

This chapter showed the implementation of the
interpolation combination algorithm in 
\cite{10.1007/11532231_26} and the necessary
changes for the EUF and UTVPI algorithms
presented in previous chapters. 

In addition, a new partially sound algorithm 
for the uniform interpolant
generation for the combined theory of EUF + UTVPI 
was introduced in the sense that the algorithm is
sound if the input formula satisfies 
particular requirements. 
The implementation of this algorithm
will be considered in the future if the rules 8 and 9
can be replaced for propagation rules that
avoid splitting. 

If the input formula in the combined theory 
satisfies the weakening conditions mentioned in
\ref{weakening_conditions}, the proposed algorithm 
produces uniform interpolants. On the other hand,
the implemented algorithm requires a $B-part$
formula to compute a conventional interpolant.
The former algorithm outputs 
a disjunction of conjunctions of equalities 
and inequalities of UTVPI terms, where the 
latter algorithm outputs
a conjunction of Horn clauses with inequalities of
UTVPI terms.
