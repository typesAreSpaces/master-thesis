\section{Conclusions}

This chapter showed the implementation of the
interpolation combination algorithm in 
\cite{10.1007/11532231_26} and the necessary
changes for the EUF and UTVPI algorithms
presented in previous chapters. 

In addition, a new algorithm for the uniform interpolant
generation for the combined theory of EUF + UTVPI 
was introduced if the input formula satisfies particular
requirements. The implementation of this algorithm
will be considered in the future if the rules 8 and 9
can be replaced for propagation rules that
avoid splitting. 

If the input formula in the combined theory 
satisfies the weakening conditions mentioned in
\ref{weakening_conditions}, then both
the proposed algorithm and the implemented algorithm
produces uniform interpolants. The former will 
output a disjunction of conjunctions of equalities 
and inequalities of UTVPI terms, where the latter outputs
a conjunction of Horn clauses with inequalities of
UTVPI terms.
