\chapter{Introduction}

Modern society is witness to the tremendous impact computer software 
has had in recent years. The benefits of this massive 
automation is endless. On the other hand, when software 
fails, it becomes a catastrophe ranging from economic loss
to threats to human life. 

Due to strict and ambitious schedules and emphasis 
on profitability, 
many software products
are shipped with unseen and unintentional 
bugs which might potentially put
at risk people's lives. Several approaches have been 
used to improve software quality. However, many of these approaches 
offer partial coverage or might take an abysmal amount 
of human effort. Thus, these approaches cannot be 
considered practical. 
Formal methods aim to bring a unique combination 
of automation, rigor, and 
efficiency (whenever efficient algorithms exit 
for the verification task). 
This thesis discusses a particular problem in 
software verification
known as \emph{the interpolation problem} for 
the theories of the quantifier-free
fragment of equality with uninterpreted functions 
(EUF) and unit two variable per
inequality (UTVPI) and their combination. These two 
theories have been 
studied extensively and researchers have found 
several applications including verification of 
hardware \cite{dilleuf} and useful 
abstract interpretation domains 
\cite{journals/corr/abs-cs-0703084}.

\section{Problem Statement}

An interpolant of a mutually inconsistent
pair of logical formulas $(\alpha, \beta)$ 
is a logical formula $\gamma$
such that $\alpha$ implies $\gamma$, $\beta \land \gamma$ is logically
inconsistent, and $\gamma$ only has common symbols of $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
Informally this means that the 
interpolant `belongs' to the consequence of $\alpha$, 
and `avoids' being part of the consequence of $\beta$. 
Not surprisingly, this intuition is in software verification 
routines where the first formula models a desirable state/property
(termination, correctness) of a computer program, and the second 
formula models the set of undesirable states (non-termination, 
errors, crashes) of such software. In Chapter 
\ref{preliminaries}, an extensive review of the formal concept 
is provided.

Even though interpolants are not an 
immediate concern in verification
problems, their use is found in the 
core algorithms of the 
following two applications:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Refinement of abstract models: In order to improve 
    coverage and decrease the complexity in verification problems,
    abstract interpretation has become an 
    effective technique to 
    accomplish the latter together with 
    model checking. Despite the fact that 
    the methodology provides sound results, it is certainly not complete.
    Several abstractions do not capture the
    semantics of programs due to the \emph{over-approximation} approach.
    Interpolation techniques can be used 
    to strengthen predicate
    abstractions by using interpolants constructed from valid 
    traces in the abstract model \cite{10.1145/876638.876643,
    10.1007/978-3-540-45069-6_1, 10.1145/982962.964021}.
  \item Invariant generation: following the same idea as in the previous
    case, \emph{if a fixed point} \cite{10.1007/11691372_33} 
    \emph{is obtained in the refinement process},
    we can obtain a logical invariant of computer programs.
    The interpolation generation approach in this application can 
    be understood as a \emph{lazy framework}
    similar to SAT/SMT algorithms. The former is
    about the production of interpolants, the latter is for 
    assignments/models respectively. Both \emph{block/learn} 
    new formulas in order to find their results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Related work}

There are several existing interpolation algorithms for the theories
discussed in the thesis work. On the one hand, there are algorithms
relying on refutational proofs. The interpolant is constructed using a
recursive function over the structure of the proof
tree. In \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-24730-2_2,mcmillan2011interpolants}
the author defines an interpolation calculus. This particular
approach uses a proof tree produced by the SMT solver Z3 
and does not need to modify any of Z3's internal mechanisms.
Among the advantages of this approach is that
theory combination is given for free since the SMT solver takes 
care of this problem. On the other hand, the decision procedures
involved in Z3 are not sufficiently integrated with its proof-producing 
mechanism in the sense that it is possible to find 
intermediate formulas in a proof-tree without explanation
introduced as lemmas. 
The latter impairs the interpolation calculus aforementioned 
because it derives an interpolant by following specific 
rules of inference.

In \cite{10.1007/11532231_26} the authors introduced a Nelson-Oppen 
framework to compute interpolants. For the convex-case, the approach 
only exchanges equalities as required by the Nelson-Oppen framework. For
the non-convex case, the authors require a resolution-based refutation proof
to compute interpolants using Pudlak's algorithm. They introduced a 
special class of theories known as 
\emph{equality interpolating theories}. 
A theory $\mathcal{T}$ belongs to this class
if whenever $\mathcal{T}$ a mixed equality $a = b$ (an equality
which contains symbols from the two formulas in the interpolating problem)
is proved,
then there exists a common term $t$ in the language of $\mathcal{T}$ 
(known as the interpolating-term) such that 
$\mathcal{T} \models a = t$ and $\mathcal{T} \models t = b$. 
The property facilitates 
formula-splitting for interpolation purposes.
In \cite{10.1007/978-3-642-00768-2_34} the authors modify a 
resolution-based refutation proof by introducing common-terms in 
the proof in order to produce interpolants in what is called
colorable-proofs, which are proof trees which do not contain AB-mixed
literals. This is pointed as an improvement to the approach followed 
in \cite{10.1007/11532231_26} which executes a similar idea but it is done 
progressively as the proof-tree is built and does not require 
\emph{equality propagating} theory solvers
\footnote{The authors in \cite{10.1007/11532231_26} require that 
  the theory solvers keep track of the interpolating-term 
  and propagate this term whenever
possible}. 
However, this result is not generalizable
to non-convex theories due to internal constraints.

Reduction-based approaches transforms the interpolation
problem into a query for some solver related to the theory. 
An example of this approach can be found in \cite{10.1007/978-3-540-69738-1_25}
where the authors use a linear-inequality solver to provide an interpolant
for the theory of linear inequalities over the rational/real numbers 
($LIA(\mathbb{Q})/LIA(\mathbb{R})$). 
Additionally, they integrate the procedure with a 
\emph{hierarchical reasoning} approach in order to incorporate 
the signature of a theory for (quantifier-free) equalities with uninterpreted 
functions.

\section{Outline of the thesis}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Chapter 2 provides background 
    of definitions and descriptions of the
    decision procedures 
    used in the thesis work.
  \item Chapters 3 discusses Kapur's uniform 
    interpolating algorithm for the theory of EUF.
    A modification to the Phase III of 
    Kapur's algorithm is proposed by introducing a 
    data structure for Horn clause processing. 
    Complexity results concerning the modification 
    proposed are reviewed. 
    One application of this data structure
    is discussed concerning the membership 
    checking of ground 
    Horn clauses in the theory of ground Horn clauses.
    The chapter provides experimental evaluation
    of the implementation of Kapur's algorithm 
    using a randomized benchmark.
  \item Chapter 4 explains Kapur's uniform interpolating
    algorithm for the UTVPI theory. A description 
    of the implementation work introduces an indexing
    data structure to efficiently represent an UTVPI
    formula. Experimental evaluation is provided at 
    the end of the chapter using a randomized 
    benchmark for the latter. 
  \item Since the combined theory of EUF and UTVPI
    does not have the uniform interpolation property 
    \cite{10.1007/978-3-030-51074-9_11},
    Chapter 5 discusses the implementation of
    a theory combination algorithm for the theories
    EUF and UTVPI using the uniform 
    interpolation algorithm from Chapter 3 and 4. 
    Additionally, an algorithm for computing 
    uniform interpolants
    is proposed which is sound if the input 
    formula satisfies a certain property.
