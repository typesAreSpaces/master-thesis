\subsection{Satisfiability and Satisfiability Modulo Theories}
 
The naive solution to satisfiability checking of a formula
consistent of enumerating all possible interpretations 
and assignments in a theory and test whether the last two are 
models for the formula. For the case of propositional logic 
we can see that such procedure with be \bigO{2^n}.
