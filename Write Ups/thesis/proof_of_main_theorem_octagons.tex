\begin{theorem}
  Given a mutually contradictory pair $(\alpha, \beta)$,
  where $\alpha, \beta$ are finite conjunctions of octagonal
  atoms, the above algorithm terminates with an interpolant
  $I_\alpha$ that is a finite conjunction of octagonal atoms
  and is equivalent to $\exists \vec{x}. \alpha$, where
  $\vec{x}$ is the symbols in $\alpha$ which are not in
  $\beta$. Further $I_\alpha$ is he strongest interpolant
  for $(\alpha, \beta)$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  First we will prove that $\models \alpha \rightarrow I_\alpha$.
  The latter follows since the algorithm produces a
  conjunction of octagonal formulas using the Elim rule,
  which is a truth-preserving rule of inference, eliminating
  conjuncts with uncommon symbols.
  
  Now, we will prove that $\not\models I_\alpha \land \beta$. We
  will prove the latter by induction on the number of variables
  to eliminate ($k$).

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Base case: $k = 0$. Then the algorithm outputs $\alpha$.
    Then the statement holds since $(\alpha, \beta)$
    is unsatisfiable.
  \item Inductive case: $k = n + 1$. Since the set $S$ of variables to eliminate
    is non-empty, we just take any variable $x \in S$ and apply the
    above algorithm to eliminate such variable.
    Let $X$ be the set of octagonal inequalities of $(\alpha, \beta)$
    and $X^{'}$ be the set of octagonal inequalities $(\alpha^{'}, \beta)$
    where $\alpha^{'}$ is the conjunct obtained after removing the
    variable $x$. We know $X$ and $X^{'}$ are equisatisfiable using
    a similar argument as in the Fourier-Motzkin elimination
    method \cite{10.5555/17634}. Let us suppose
    $(\alpha^{'}, \beta)$ is satisfiable, hence $(\alpha, \beta)$
    is satisfiable as well. But the latter entails a contradiction
    since $(\alpha, \beta)$ is assumed to be unsatisfiable. Hence,
    $(\alpha^{'}, \beta)$ is unsatisfiable. Since $(\alpha^{'}, \beta)$
    is an unsatisfiable formula with $n$ variables to eliminate,
    using the Inductive Hypothesis we conclude that $(I_\alpha, \beta)$
    is unsatisfiable as well.
  \end{itemize}
