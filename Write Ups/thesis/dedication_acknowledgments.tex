  I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Martin Sheen, for his support
  and some great action movies.  I would also like to thank my dog, Spot,
  who only ate my homework two or three times.  I have several other people
  I would like to thank, as well.\footnote{To my brother and sister, who
    are really cool.}
