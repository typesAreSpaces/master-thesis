\subsection{Nelson-Oppen framework for theory and interpolation
combination}

This theory combination problem consists on taking a 
formula from the union of two (or more) disjoint 
languages and tell if such formula is satisfiable
or not in the combined theory, i.e. a theory resulting
after putting together two (or more) axiomatizations.

\begin{example}
Let us consider the
