# Theory combination chapter:

* Fix section 5.4 since no uniform interpolant generation algorithm
for EUF + UTVPI exists.
* Add a section (or perhaps explain the following in the abstract)
about the lack of the UI property in the EUF + UTVPI combined theory.
* Work on section 5.4.3:
  - Add the condition under which a UI is generated. 
  - Explain how the output looks like.
  - Explain difference between the algorithm in the (old) section
  5.1.
  - Add examples to illustrate the algorithm.
