\section{Kapur's Uniform Interpolant Algorithm for
the UTVPI theory}

The algorithm proposed \cite{KAPUR2017} uses inference rules
to obtain the normal form of the conjunction of inequalities
of octagon formulas as well as 
eliminating the uncommon variables from the
A-part of the input formula. The rules are the following:

\begin{center}
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo[]{a x + a x \leq c}
    \hypo[]{a \in \{ -1, 0, 1 \}$ and $x \in Vars}
    \infer2[Normalize]{a x \leq \floor{\frac{c}{2}}}
  \end{prooftree}

  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo[]{s_1 x_1 + s_2 x_2 \leq c_1}
    \hypo[]{- s_2 x_2 + s_3 x_3 \leq c_2}
    \infer2[Elim]{s_1 x_1 + s_3 x_3 \leq c_1 + c_2}
  \end{prooftree}
\end{center}

The algorithm normalizes the inequalities at the beginning as 
a preprocessing step and applies the Normalize and Elim rule 
whenever it is possible until no more uncommon variables 
remain in the input formula. Hence, having an efficient 
representation of 
the inequalities and match detection (similar to detecting pivots for
resolution in SAT) is important for an efficient implementation.
