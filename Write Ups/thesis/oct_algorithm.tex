\section{Algorithm}

The algorithm proposed \cite{KAPUR2017} uses inference rules
to close the relation and eliminate the uncommon variables from the
A-part of the input formula. The rules are the following:

\begin{center}
  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo[]{s_1 x_1 + s_2 x_2 \leq c}
    \hypo[]{s_1 = s_2 \in \{ -1, 0, 1 \}$ and $x_1 = x_2 \in Vars}
    \infer2[Normalize]{s_1 x_1 \leq \floor{\frac{c}{2}}}
  \end{prooftree}

  \begin{prooftree}
    \hypo[]{s_1 x_1 + s_2 x_2 \leq c_1}
    \hypo[]{- s_2 x_2 + s_3 x_3 \leq c_2}
    \infer2[Elim]{s_1 x_1 + s_3 x_3 \leq c_1 + c_2}
  \end{prooftree}
\end{center}

The algorithm normalizes the inequalities at the beginning as 
a preprocessing step and applies the Elim rule whenever it is
possible until no more uncommon variables remain in the 
input formula. Hence, having an efficient representation of 
the inequalities and detecting matches (like pivots for
resolution steps) is important for an efficient implementation.
To achieve this goal we implemented to an encoding of 
the inequalities using natural numbers, an array of 
numbers indexed by the numeral representation of the  inequalities
which keeps track of the minimum bound of the encoded inequality,
and a data structure to keep track of the signs of variables
in the inequalities for efficient matching.
