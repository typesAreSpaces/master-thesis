\chapter{Combining Theories: EUF and Octagonal Formulas}

A relevant comment from the paper A combination method for generating interpolants.

The question is how to split it inot two formulas, A' and B'. The condition for splitting is that
the common symbols for <A', B'> should be (a subset of) AB-common symbols, because we would like
to use the resultant interpolant for <A', B'> as a part of an interpolant
for the original A and B.

  Suppose that Eq contains only AB-pure equalities ...

  The latter captures the idea behind equality-interpolating theories. The core definition guarantees 
  that the Nelson-Oppen combination framework is able to propagate  
  AB-pure equalities so the splitting part is not a concern for the algorithm.
