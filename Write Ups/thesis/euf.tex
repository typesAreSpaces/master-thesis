\chapter{The Theory of EUF}

\begin{theorem}
  Let $t$ be an uncommon term and let $H$ be a collection of Horn equations.
  Assume $antecedent(H) \neq \{\}$. If $consequent(t) = \{\}$, then we cannot
  conditionality eliminate $t$ from any Horn equation $h \in H$. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose, by contradiction, that we can conditionally eliminate the term
  $t$ from $H$. Then, there exists $h^{'} \in H$ such that $t$ appears in the
  consequent of $h^{'}$. But $consequent(t) = \{\}$, contradiction.
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
  We cannot eliminate an uncommont term $t$ unconditionally once
  $consequent(t) = \{\}$.
\end{corollary}
