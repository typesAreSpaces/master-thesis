\section{Decision Procedures} \label{decision_procedures}

Given a theory $\mathcal{T}$ in a formula $\psi$ in 
the language of the theory, is it possible to know 
$\models_{\mathcal{T}} \psi$? The last question is 
known as the verification of the decision problem for 
the respective theory $\mathcal{T}$. This question has 
been studied extensively for many theories of interest 
\cite{borger2001classical}. 

Regarding the decidability of the theories 
mentioned in Section \ref{math_theories}, it is known that 
EUF is undecidable \cite{borger2001classical}, and the theory
of ordered commutative rings is undecidable when the
structure uses integers as the domain and the semantics
of the arithmetical operations \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0076838} 
(on the other hand, this theory can be decidable if we
keep the same structure but use the reals as the domain
\cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0076838}).
Nonetheless, the quantifier-free fragment of EUF and 
the restriction imposed in the decision problem for 
the UTVPI theory allow efficient algorithms to decide 
validity and satisfiability in their respective theories 
\cite{10.1145/322186.322198, 10.1145/322217.322228, 
10.1007/11559306_9}.

In the rest of this section we review some decision 
problems and provide references to their respective
decision procedures used in the implementation work of 
the thesis.
