\section{Decision Procedures} \label{decision_procedures}

Given a theory $\mathcal{T}$ and a formula $\psi$ in 
the language of $\mathcal{T}$, is it possible to know 
$\models_{\mathcal{T}} \psi$? The last question is 
known as the decision problem for 
$\mathcal{T}$. This question has 
been studied extensively for many theories of interest 
\cite{borger2001classical}. 

Regarding the decidability of the theories 
discussed in the thesis work, it is known that 
the quantified EUF theory is undecidable \cite{borger2001classical}
Nonetheless, the quantifier-free fragment of EUF and 
the restriction imposed in the decision problem for 
the UTVPI theory allow efficient algorithms to decide 
validity and satisfiability in their respective theories 
\cite{10.1145/322186.322198, 10.1145/322217.322228, 
10.1007/11559306_9}. The ordered abelian group theory
is decidable as well \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0076838}.

In the rest of this section we review some decision 
problems and provide references to their respective
decision procedures used in the implementation work of 
the thesis.
