\subsubsection{Decision Procedure}

In \cite{GALLIER1987233} it was proposed an algorithm 
for testing the unsatisfiability
of ground Horn clauses with equality. The main idea was 
to interleave two algorithms: \emph{implicational propagation}
(propositional satisfiability of Horn clauses) that 
updates the truth value of equations in the antecedent 
of the input Horn clauses \cite{DOWLING1984267}; and 
\emph{equational propagation} (congruence closure for 
grounded equations) to update the state of a 
Union-Find data structure \cite{10.1145/364099.364331}
that keeps the minimal equivalence relation defined 
by grounded equations in the input Horn clauses.

The author in \cite{GALLIER1987233} defined two 
variations of his algorithms by adapting
the Congruence Closure algorithms in 
\cite{10.1145/322217.322228, 10.1145/322186.322198}.
Additionally, modifications in the data structures 
used by the original algorithms were needed
to make the interleaving mechanism more efficient.
