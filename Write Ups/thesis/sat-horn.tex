\subsection{Satisfiability of Horn clauses with ground equations}

In \cite{GALLIER1987233} it was proposed an algorithm 
for testing the unsatisfiability
of ground Horn clauses with equality. The main idea was 
to interleave two algorithms: \emph{implicational propagation}
(propositional satisfiability of Horn clauses) that 
updates the truth value of equations in the antecedent 
of the input Horn clauses \cite{DOWLING1984267}; and 
\emph{equational propagation} (congruence closure for 
grounded equations) to update the state of a 
Union-Find data structure \cite{10.1145/364099.364331}
that keeps the minimal equivalence relation defined 
by grounded equations in the input Horn clauses.

The author in \cite{GALLIER1987233} defined two 
variations of his algorithms by adapting
the Congruence Closure algorithms in 
\cite{10.1145/322217.322228, 10.1145/322186.322198}.
Additionally, modifications in the data structures 
used by the original algorithms were needed
to make the interleaving mechanism more efficient.

Our implementation uses the equality propagation
mechanism in the algorithm proposed by Gallier
when we have to deal with Horn clauses with ground
equations. In addition, we also needed to design
some modifications of the original formulation so
it can integrate with the congruence closure with
explanation algorithm mentioned in the previous 
section.
