\section{Conclusions}

This chapter discussed the new approach
for uniform interpolant generation introduced by
Prof. Kapur for the EUF theory. We 
proposed a modification of his algorithm
and proved its correctness. The 
implementation and testing work confirm
that the approach produces stronger interpolants
compared to other interpolant generation
algorithms (iZ3, Mathsat).

The performance comparison section indicates
that of our implementation is slower 
than iZ3. 
On the other hand, it is important to 
highlight that the algorithms have different
output specification since Prof. Kapur algorithm
computes uniform interpolants.

The current implementation can be improved. 
Currently, the data structures
for flattening introduce additional constants
that might not be needed since the implementation
used a recursive scan of the arguments for each
expression without checking term sharing.
Moreover, the explanation mechanism can be
improved or changed by the proof producing mechanism
already available in Z3.
