Introduction
------------

Xgnuplot is an X-windows interface to the popular gnuplot porgram built
using Tcl and Tk.  The Xgnuplot application provides a convenient means
to set gnuplot options using a point and click approach.  Since the
application is written entirely in the scripting language Tcl using the
Tk toolkit, it is extensible and users can easily add additional functionality.

The application works by communicating with gnuplot via a pipe and therefore
it is not necessary to recompile gnuplot or modify it in any way.  This is
the first release of Xgnuplot and although I believe it is already a useful
program the intention is to develop it further adding support for other
tools. Tcl provides an excellent "glue" to build powerful applications
from smaller tools using a range of inter-process communication methods.
Xgnuplot therefore makes it easy to integrate many applications using
gnuplot for the visualization.

This first release of Xgnuplot is not being advertised on to the Tcl
community as current the documentation is poor, however it should be 
possible for anyone with a passing knowledge of gnuplot to use the 
application.  Specifically, there is no documentation on how to use 
Xgnuplot as "glue" however experienced Tcl/Tk programmers who are also 
familiar with gnuplot, should find it quite straight forward.


Plotting a Function or a data file
----------------------------------

To plot a function, for example sin(x), enter the function to plot in the
entry field to the right of the "Line x" "Function" and "File" buttons for
one of the lines.  For the line to be plotted the "Line x" check button
must be "on".  You must also select the type to be "Function" by clicking
on the radio button "Function".  When both are set, click on "Plot" in the 
main command bar; the function will then be displayed in a gnuplot X11 window.
By default the key will be set to the text representing the plotted function, 
you can overide this by entering text in the entry field to the right of the
"Title:" check button, for example enter the text "First line" and click
on plot again -- your function will be re-displayed with a different entry
in the key.

To plot a data file simply enter the file name in the field you used to enter
the function, but select the "File" radio button (only one of Function or
File can be selected at any one time).  The format of the file must conform
to that specified normally for gnuplot (see the gnuplot manual for more
details).  You may select the columns of the file to plot by entering
appropriate numbers in the columns fields at the bottom of the line entry
panel.

To plot more than one function/file simply make entries in any one of the
ten line entry panels (you can see them all by using the scrollbar to the
right of the main Xgnuplot window).  Only those lines for which the "Line"
checkbutton is "on" are actually plotted when the "Plot" button is clicked
on.

If the function is a function of x and y or the data file is a function of
two coordinates, you should select a 3D plot by clicking on the Radio button
in the main command bar to select a 3D plot option.

Line and symbol styles used to display the data are selected from the
"Style:" "Line:" and "Point:" menus n the third row of the line entry panel.


Hard Copy Output
----------------

To obtain hard copy output select "Hard Copy Output ..." from the File
menu.  A new window will appear which will allow you to type the name of
an output file (the default is "dump") and select the type of hardcopy
output (Postscript or Fig output may be selected from the menu).


Defining Functions
------------------

Function definitions can be entered using a scratch pad; select 
"Function Scratch Pad ..." from the File menu and a window will appear
in which you can enter function definitions in a format suitable for
gnuplot, for example:

   f(x) = x**2

Function definitions may be saved by clicking on "Save".  To make the
function definitions available for use in functions to plot you need to
click on the "Apply" button.


Options
-------

A full range of options may be specified for the plots.  The options
appropriate to each line are set in the line panels themselves (i.e.
type -- Function/File -- style, line-style, point-style, columns to plot
etc.).  Options for the complete plot can be set by selecting an appropriate
entry from the Options menu.  In each case a new window will appear in
which options can be set:

  Main...       Titles, axes and data range, data sampling etc.
  3D...         3D plot options, orientation, style, contour options etc.
  Parametric... Options for parametric (f(t)) plots
  Polar...      Options for polar plots
  Miscellaneous Various options which do not fit in anywhere else.

For more details on exactly what the options mean consult the gnuplot
manual for details of the options that you may wich to set and then
select these from the appropriate menus.  Alternatively just give it a
try and see what happens.


Tools
-----

The tools menu is a "place holder" for furture additions to the options
available from Xgnuplot.
