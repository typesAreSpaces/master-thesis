DESCR:  LaTeX Document style option "setspace"
        Usage:  \usepackage{setspace}
        Based on the doublespace option created by Stephen Page.

This style option provides commands and environments for doing double and
one-and-a-half spacing based on pt size.

Single spacing is the default.

Three commands, \doublespacing, \onehalfspacing, and \singlespacing, are for
use in the preamble to set the overall spacing for the document.  If a
different spacing is required then the \setstretch{baselinestretch} command
can be used in the preamble to set the baselinestretch appropriately.  The
default spacing with this style option is single spacing.

Three environments, singlespace, onehalfspace, and doublespace, allow the
spacing to be changed within the document.  For example, the doublespace
environment is envoked using the commands \begin{doublespace} text
\end{doublespace}. Both the onehalfspace and doublespace environments are
intended to increase the spacing, so the onehalfspace environment should not
be used in a double spaced document.  If an increased spacing different from
one-and-a-half or double spacing is required then the spacing environment can
be used.  The spacing environment takes one argument which is the larger
baselinestretch to use, (e.g., \begin{spacing}{2.5} text \end{spacing}.

\footins is adjusted the same as \parskip - appears to work. Lose stretch
parts but don't consider that to be crucial

MODS:
       Redefinition of \spacing and \endspacing for consistency with
       TeX 3.x inserted by George Greenwade.  Modification provided by
       Philip Ross (ROSS@UK.AC.ABDN.BIOMED) and John Byrne via INFO-TeX.

PLEASE REPORT ANY BUGS

Old Documentation follows:
       1. A new environment "singlespace" is provided, within which single
          spacing will apply.
          JFL - changed so that it works in regular text and so that
          vertical space before and after is correctly computed
       2. Double spacing is turned off within footnotes and floats (figures
          and tables).
       3. Proper double spacing happens below tabular environments and in
          other places where LaTeX uses a strut.
       4. Slightly more space is inserted before footnotes.
       5. JFL - fixes spacing before and after displayed math


POSSIBLE BUGS:
  . Increasing struts may possibly cause some other obscure part of
    formatting to fall over.
  . \begin{singlespace}\begin{quote} produces the wrong spacing before
    the quote (extra glue is inserted).
