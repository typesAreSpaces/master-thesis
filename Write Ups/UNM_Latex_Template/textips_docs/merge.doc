A version of these macros appeared in TUGboat 8 #1, April 1987.

Merge is a substyle [option] under the Latex style 'Letter' which
merges a standard letter with a separate file containing addresses
and opening lines.  Merge will read {address}{opening} pairs from a
specified file and merge them with a form letter by producing a separate
letter environment (containing unique "\begin{letter}{address}" and
"\opening{opening}" commands) for each pair.  


The basic algorithm is:
     1. Open the address file.
     2. Read the addresses file getting the address and opening line.
     3. Process the contents of the MERGE environment and store it
        in a box (\@store). This is the standard part of the letter.
     4. Produce the start of the letter (your address (including date),
        their address, and the opening line).
     5. Make a copy of the standard letter (\@store) and unbox this copy.
     6. Repeat steps 2, 4, and 5 (not 3) until there are no more addresses.

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

A letter, say LETTER.TEX, would be set up as follows:

\documentstyle[merge]{letter}

\address{...}		% your address
\signature{...}		% your signature

\begin{document}
\begin{merge}{myaddresses}	% MYADDRESSES.TEX contains addresses+openings

With regard to ....		% letter starts

\closing{...}		% closing
\ps{...}			% \ps, \encl, \cc, etc.

\end{merge}
\end{document}

The address file, MYADDRESSES.TEX, would contain:

{Computing Services Centre, \\	% first address
 University of Otago, \\
 Dunedin, \\
 New Zealand}
{Dear Graeme,}		% \opening for first address
{Charles S. Roberson\\	% next address
 Dept. of Computer Science\\
 College of William and Mary\\
 Williamsburg, VA  23185}
{Dear Chip,}			% next \opening
....				% etc.

NOTES:
  Braces are matched, except that if the input is only one line then it
    is not necessary to contain it within braces.
  It is important to leave NO BLANK LINES at the end of the address file.
  Be sure to supply the "\\" for breaking the addresses. -csr
